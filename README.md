## Dynamic map of the existing and future hydroelectric reservoirs and their greenhouse gas emission (GHG) estimates for the country of Myanmar.

The map demonstrates predictive and visualisation capabilities of our open-source software "RE-Emission" - see [https://github.com/tomjanus/reemission](https://github.com/tomjanus/reemission). RE-Emission estimates greenhouse gas emissions from water bodies using the well-established state-of-the-art `G-Res` model. G-Res, and what follows, RE-Emission, require a significant amount of input data about the catchment and the reservoir. This data usually comes as an output of a reservoir and catchment delineation studies which are done manually per reservoir. In this study, the input data came from our reservoir and catchment delineation tool called `HEET`. This tool is able to perform delineations automatically, thus allowing processing large numbers of reservoirs at once. It is currently undergoing heavy development and for this reason, it has not been made part of the public domain yet. It shall be published as open-source free software in due time.

This repository creates GitHub Pages at [https://tomjanus.github.io/mya_emissions_map/](https://tomjanus.github.io/mya_emissions_map/) that serves as a demonstration and visualises the selected outputs of a study investigating gas emission intensities of different existing and planned hydropower generation sites in Myanmar. The study is aimed to shed more light onto gas emissions associated with hydroelectric power generation in general and work as a decision making aid in preparation of hydropower expansion plans in Myanmar.

A snapshot of the map is shown below.
